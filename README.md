# kmeanssegmentation

kMeans image segmentation completed during my senior year of college at UW ECE

if you want to run this program, you'll need to download both kMean files and store them in the same directory

place the photos that you want to run the program on in the same directory as well.

Then, using MATLAB software, you can run the files and specify which images you'd like to use
